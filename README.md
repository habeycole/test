This shows a workaround of how our quiz app is meant to work.

We are going to create a quiz app using HTML, CSS and JS that resides on the web browser. This quiz/test app is meant to be very easy to use and we won't be saving any sessions nor working with any DB. It'll solely reside on the browser so we're working with front-end web stacks: HTML, CSS and JS.

Also, I'd like to point out that this project still needs lots of improvements and one of the improvements on my roadmap would be to randomly generate quiz questions from different sources using publicly available APIs without the need to write the questions in the files. Project improvements can also be made on this project from individual users. Feel free to fork and use this project as you'd like.
